      <!-- PspDeleteVdmObjects -->
      <h1>&nbsp;&#129154; PspDeleteVdmObjects</h1>
      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Description</u></h3>
      <p>
         Deletes Virtual DOS Machine (DOS) objects. The function is called in a process deletion scenario (called by <b>PspDeleteProcess</b>).
      </p>

      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Internals & Parameters</u></h3>
      <pre id = "prototype">
VOID
NTAPI
PspDeleteVdmObjects(IN PEPROCESS Process)
      </pre>

      <p>
         <b>Process</b> is a pointer to a Executive process (EPROCESS). The function internally frees the <b>VdmObjects</b> member of the EPROCESS structure and deletes the Executive
         resource from the system's resources list. Besides that, the function also deallocates the memory pool block within the memory space of the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) objects.
         A peculiarity to take into consideration regard this function is that this function returns the process pool quota (PsReturnProcessPagedPoolQuota and PsReturnProcessNonPagedPoolQuota
         being called respectively). A possible theory is that the returned paged pool quota is from the deallocated VDM objects that were taking up the space in the memory area.
      </p>

      <p>
         In a non-paged pool scenario however, the actual pool quota returned comes from the allocated Executive process pointed by EPROCESS, that is guaranteed to stay in the physical
         memory area. This function doesn't return anything. The called functions for this routine are:
      </p>
      <pre>
         - ExFreePoolWithTag
         - ExDeleteResourceLite
         - PsReturnProcessPagedPoolQuota
         - PsReturnProcessNonPagedPoolQuota
      </pre>

      <!-- PspVdmInitialize -->
      <h1>&nbsp;&#129154; PspVdmInitialize</h1>
      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Description</u></h3>
      <p>
         Initializes the Virtual DOS Machine (DOS) in boot phase.
      </p>

      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Internals & Parameters</u></h3>
      <pre id = "prototype">
NTSTATUS
NTAPI
PspVdmInitialize(VOID)
      </pre>

      <p>
         The function takes no parameters, it merely initializes the VDM during boot phase specifically during process manager initialization procedure -- first phase (PspInitPhase0).
         PspInitPhase0 is invoked by PsInitSystem, the completion of the 1st phase leads with the preparation for the 2nd phase initialization. PspVdmInitialize returns a NTSTATUS value,
         STATUS_SUCCESS respectively. The function invokes the Executive to add the VDM resource in the system resources list which in turn the kernel is responsible for managing such resource
         for whatever purpose in the context of VDM.
      </p>

      <p>
         The called function for this routine is:
      </p>
      <pre>
         - ExInitializeResourceLite
      </pre>
   </body>
