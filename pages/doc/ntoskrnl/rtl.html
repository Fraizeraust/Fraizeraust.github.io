      <h1>&nbsp;Run-Time kernel library summary</h1>

      <p>
         The Run-Time library (RTL) is a kernel executive module that provides the Run-Time interface and routines for the NT kernel itself and kernel mode drivers. The
         library comprises a set of functions for string operations, arithemtic operations, data type conversions and a whole lot more. Functions that belong in the RTL
         executive module of the Executive realm of the kernel denote with a prefix as <b>Rtl</b> whereas private Run-Time library functions that aren't exported
         nor used outside of the said module start with <b>Rtlp</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
         Albeit the RTL kernel service module brings the kernel mode RTL interface in the kernel realm, there's another Run-Time library specifically used for the user mode
         realm, which it can be found in the NTDLL layer (or simply the Native API layer infrastructure). Interestingly enough, some RTL functions can be found in either
         operating system space, whether it's in kernel mode or user mode -- an example of such a function being <code>RtlGetVersion</code>. A possible theory and explanation
         for this is that Microsoft took a decision to have certain functions of the same nature in terms of synopsis but with slightly (or complete) different implementation to satisfy
         both parties -- the kernel mode and user mode. With that said, taking <code>RtlGetVersion</code> again as an example, it is implemented in the kernel executive module, RTL,
         in such a way in order to cover the needs and reflect the design in kernel mode. Hence for this matter, Windows ensures that the caller executes the right call of the right ring
         level (a user mode software cannot call the kernel mode variant of the function or vice versa).

      <!-- RtlGetNtProductType -->
      <h1>&nbsp;&#129154; RtlGetNtProductType</h1>
      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Description</u></h3>
      <p>
         Retrieves the NT type product of the operating system.
      </p>

      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Internals & Parameters</u></h3>
      <pre id = "prototype">
BOOLEAN
NTAPI
RtlGetNtProductType(OUT PNT_PRODUCT_TYPE ProductType)
      </pre>

      <p>
         <b>ProductType</b> is a pointer to a NT_PRODUCT_TYPE enumeration. The product type can be either Workstation (WinNT), Server (ServerNT) and Advanced Server (LanmanNT).
         The product type defines the usage of the operating system (Workstation in this case, is regarded for daily-life low-end user usage). This kernel mode function relies
         on the Registry to query the type of the operating system product. The function returns <b>TRUE</b> on success, <b>FALSE</b> otherwise. In the latter case, <u>WinNT</u>
         is returned to the output argument parameter of the function to the caller as the default product type on failure.
      </p>

      <p>
         The called functions for this routine are:
      </p>
      <pre>
         - RtlInitUnicodeString
         - ZwOpenKey
         - ExAllocatePoolWithTag
         - ZwQueryValueKey
         - RtlEqualUnicodeString
         - ExFreePoolWithTag
         - ZwClose
      </pre>

      <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Remarks</u></h3>
      <p>
         As told in the section of the function above, RtlGetNtProductType queries thorough the Registry to grab the product type of the operating system. In comparison to the
         user mode variant of the function in NTDLL layer, the user mode variant caches the product type data from a particular kernel data structure, <b>_KUSER_SHARED_DATA</b>.
         This structure is managed internally and initialized by the NT kernel during boot initialization phase.
