# ReactOS Tutorials
ReactOS Tutorials is a website written in HTML & CSS where I personally provide tutorials as well as guidelines that could be useful for absolute beginners when contributing to ReactOS for the first time.

## When will you include XYZ tutorial?
I am doing this in my spare time and generally I post tutorials regarding stuff that I am familiar with or I've knowledge in the matter. Furthermore it's worth noting that initially the tutorial pages
are stubs and rather incomplete and I gradually update them when I can.

## Internals documentation disclaimer
Besides tutorials I also host and publish several documentation details about APIs, such as functions that weren't documented originally thorough the Internet. ReactOS targets Windows Server 2003 internally and for this reason why I use the platform as the main OS for reverse engineering and conducting research. 

WinDBG is my favourite debugging and reverse engineering tool of choice for my research. I DO NOT and CAN'T guarantee that whatever I write in the documentation is fully confirmed so whatever is written in the past might change in the future.
