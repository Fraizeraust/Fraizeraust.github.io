# ReactOS Tutorials
ReactOS Tutorials is a website written in HTML & CSS where I personally provide tutorials as well as guidelines that could be useful for absolute beginners when contributing to ReactOS for the first time.

## When will you include XYZ tutorial?
I am doing this in my spare time and generally I post tutorials regarding stuff that I am familiar with or I've knowledge in the matter. Furthermore it's worth noting that initially the tutorial pages
are stubs and rather incomplete and I gradually update them when I can.

## Maintainers

This repository is not affiliated with the ReactOS Organization and Team in any way!
