- Use 3 spaces for indentation when writing a HTML file!
- If images don't fit correctly within the `body` element of the article, hardcode the `width` and `height` parameters of `<img>` HTML tag accordingly!
- Every article must come with a "table of contents" at the top of the article. [First Time Git Setup](https://github.com/GeoB99/GeoB99.github.io/blob/master/pages/first-setup-git.html) is an example of how a HTML document article should look like.
- Provide external sources of other articles or links in case you've found other useful resources that relate to the tutorial article you're writing!
